2. Load libraries and run pre-built programs to experiment with sensors and actuators.
     - Load required libraries, as described in the tutorial for the hardware kit.
     - Load some pre-built programs and run on the hardware.
     - Write my own rule-based programs or copy and modify existing ones.
     - Move the car forward, backward, turn.
     - Make the car track a line.
     - Identify/avoid an obstacle.
     - Send Serial communication back and forth between car and a device/computer.
